# Lama Project Front-End (Full-stack Project also in same Github)

This is a front-end for an e-commerce clothing store

-   Using React
-   Using Typescript
-   Using React stylised components (CSS/TSX), it is also completely responsive (small edit required on nav, too much space to the right, not enough space on left)
-   There are 6 pages ( Home, Cart, Product, ProductList, Register, Login)
-   There is a data.ts file for resources (images, etc), this is accessed via a .map method
-   There is a responsive.ts file this is used for media queries to avoid code duplication, and increase reusability
-   The code is modular, which reusable components such as navbar and footer etc
-   This code can be refactored by creating smaller components in the Register/Login page (although styling is different, but can be seperated), and maybe using data.ts file for background of these pages, as this project is not too large, this may not be necessary

-   BACKEND
-   The backend of this project is create in node.ts/express, is can be found in the github at address ****\_\_\_\_****

-   PROJECT
-   This is a fullstack using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.ts, React.ts, Node.ts), using typescript for both the front-end and back-end

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
